> Starter Template for fullstack apps with preact islands

A tiny base to start your full stack projects with, it's built with the DIY
philosophy so you are free to modify and build upon whatever is here in the
template. There are no opinions since it's just JS and no magic, other than
maybe the preact-island-plugin.
